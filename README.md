# Classes in Ruby
The purpose of this app was to demonstrate the following:
* Creating classes
* Creating multiple objects
* Add properties to objects
* Use accessors
* Add methods and behaviours
* Get methods and behaviours to interact with properties

This was achieved by creating three Ruby classes; student, sports_team and library which were made to interact with each other. 

# Run Tests
To run the tests use the following commands in terminal:
```Ruby
ruby specs/library_spec.rb
ruby specs/sports_team_spec.rb
ruby specs/student_spec.rb
```
